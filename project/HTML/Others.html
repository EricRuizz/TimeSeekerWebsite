                The TimeSeeker website is my little handcrafted corner of the internet, a personal storage where I display the things I've done no matter how much I might dislike them. I get to publish my stuff whithout forcefully pushing it in front of people's faces, something that I do not enjoy so much.
                Localthunk once put into words something that I had been feeling for a while, he expressed the idea of documenting one's journey and thoughts not only for sharing, but for the sake of not forgetting.<br>
                <br>
                This site was built using HTML, CSS, Typescript and GLSL, with Vite as a frontend build tool, GSAP as the only library and hosted with GitHub Pages. Except for GLSL, I had to learn all the other the programming languages from scratch as well as the ins and outs of a new development environment, a browser, etc... There are many options out there for anyone looking to <i>have</i> a website, all of them easy and fast to use in order to quickly and effortlessly achieve results, which of course comes at the expense of a good amount of freedom. I didn't only want to <i>have</i> a website, I wanted to <i>build</i> one myself.<br>
                <br>
                I believe I got the desire to make a website sometime between 2021 and 2022, when I found out about <a href="https://stuffedwomb.at/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stuffedwomb.at</a>, the site of an indie game developer that I had been following for a while.
                There, Stuffed Wombat shares a lot of his knowledge about game development. I got to know more about him and his work, and thought it was amazing! So, obviously, the next step was to build one myself from scratch.<br>
                <br>
                As a last little fun fact, before this site existed as we know it, I was working in a much more... "experimental" version of it. I was looking for a very unique landing experience, called the <a href="/project_BreathPage/pages/home.html">Breath Page</a>, a page that greeted the user before getting to the actual content, simply aiming to make people take a second before they continued with what they were doing. I really enjoyed making it, but for various reasons I decided to go for a much smoother and cleaner approach.<br>
